# [Kosmos-2.5: A Multimodal Literate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11419)
Kosmos-2.5 is a multimodal literate model for machine reading of text-intensive images. Pre-trained on large-scale text-intensive images, Kosmos-2.5 excels in two distinct yet cooperative transcription tasks: (1) generating spatially-aware text blocks, where each block of text is assigned its spatial coordinates within the image, and (2) producing structured text output that captures styles and structures into the markdown format. This unified multimodal literate capability is achieved through a shared decoder-only auto-regressive Transformer architecture, task-specific prompts, and flexible text representations. We evaluate Kosmos-2.5 on end-to-end document-level text recognition and image-to-markdown text generation. Furthermore, the model can be readily adapted for any text-intensive image understanding task with different prompts through supervised fine-tuning, making it a general-purpose tool for real-world applications involving text-rich images. This work also paves the way for the future scaling of multimodal large language models.

## News
- May 2024: ðŸ”¥We've open-sourced the checkpoint and inference code of Kosmos-2.5, This checkpoint has been trained for more steps than the one reported in the paper.  
- Sep 2023: We release the **Kosmos-2.5: A Multimodal Literate Model** paper. Checkout the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11419).

## Installation
The code uses [Flash Attention2](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention), so it only runs on Ampere, Ada, or Hopper GPUs (e.g., A100, RTX 3090, RTX 4090, H100).
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/unilm.git
cd unilm
cd kosmos-2.5
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference

  ``` bash
  python inference.py \
    --do_ocr \                      // --do_md for image2md task
    --image path/to/image \
    --ckpt path/to/checkpoint \ 
  ```
For images with extreme aspect ratios, we recommend resizing images to a more typical aspect ratio for better performance with the following command:
  ``` bash
  python inference.py \
    --do_ocr \                      // --do_md for image2md task
    --image path/to/image \
    --ckpt path/to/checkpoint \
    --use_preprocess \
    --hw_ratio_adj_upper_span "[1.5, 5]" \
    --hw_ratio_adj_lower_span "[0.5, 1.0]" 
  ```
  Please adjust the parameters based on your use cases. For example,
  - `--hw_ratio_adj_upper_span "[1.5, 5]"` indicates that if the image's aspect ratio is between 1.5 and 5, the image will be resized to an aspect ratio of 1.5. 
  - `--hw_ratio_adj_lower_span "[0.5, 1.0]"` indicates that if the image's aspect ratio is between 0.5 and 1.0, the image will be resized to an aspect ratio of 1.0.
  
  

## NOTE:
Since this is a generative model, there is a risk of **hallucination** during the generation process, and it **CAN NOT** guarantee the accuracy of all OCR/Markdown results in the images.
