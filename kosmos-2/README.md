## GRIT: Large-Scale Training Corpus of Grounded Image-Text Pairs

We introduce GRIT, a large-scale dataset of **Gr**ounded **I**mage-**T**ext pairs, which is created based on image-text pairs from a subset of COYO-700M and LAION-2B.
We construct a pipeline to extract and link text spans (i.e., noun phrases, and referring expressions) in the caption to their corresponding image regions.
More details can be found in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14824).


### Download Data
- [GrIT-20M](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zzliang/GRIT): The split contains about 20M grounded image-caption pairs processed from COYO-700M.

The format of data instance is:

```python
{
  'clip_similarity_vitb32': 0.353271484375, 
  'clip_similarity_vitl14': 0.2958984375, 
  'id': 1795296605919, 
  'url': "https://www.thestrapsaver.com/wp-content/uploads/customerservice-1.jpg", 
  'caption': 'a wire hanger with a paper cover that reads we heart our customers', 
  'width': 1024, 
  'height': 693, 
  'noun_chunks': [[19, 32, 0.019644069503434333, 0.31054004033406574, 0.9622142865754519, 0.9603442351023356, 0.79298526], [0, 13, 0.019422357885505368, 0.027634161214033764, 0.9593302408854166, 0.969467560450236, 0.67520964]], 
  'ref_exps': [[19, 66, 0.019644069503434333, 0.31054004033406574, 0.9622142865754519, 0.9603442351023356, 0.79298526], [0, 66, 0.019422357885505368, 0.027634161214033764, 0.9593302408854166, 0.969467560450236, 0.67520964]]
}

```
- `clip_similarity_vitb32`: The cosine similarity between text and image(ViT-B/32) embeddings by [OpenAI CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP), provided by COYO-700M.
- `clip_similarity_vitl14`: The cosine similarity between text and image(ViT-L/14) embeddings by [OpenAI CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP), provided by COYO-700M.
- `id`: Unique 64-bit integer ID in COYO-700M.
- `url`: The image URL.
- `caption`: The corresponding caption.
- `width`: The width of the image.
- `height`: The height of the image.
- `noun_chunks`: The noun chunks (extracted by [spaCy](https://spacy.io/)) that have associated bounding boxes (predicted by [GLIP](https://github.com/microsoft/GLIP)). The items in the children list respectively represent 'Start of the noun chunk in caption', 'End of the noun chunk in caption', 'normalized x_min', 'normalized y_min', 'normalized x_max', 'normalized y_max', 'confidence score'.
- `ref_exps`: The corresponding referring expressions. If a noun chunk has no expansion, we just copy it. 

Run the following commands to visualize it:
```bash
DLINK=$(echo -n "aHR0cHM6Ly9jb252ZXJzYXRpb25odWIuYmxvYi5jb3JlLndpbmRvd3MubmV0L2JlaXQtc2hhcmUtcHVibGljL2tvc21vcy0yL2RhdGEvZ3JpdF9jb3lvLmpzb25sP3N2PTIwMjMtMDEtMDMmc3Q9MjAyNC0wNC0xMFQxMyUzQTExJTNBNDRaJnNlPTIwNTAtMDQtMTFUMTMlM0ExMSUzQTAwWiZzcj1jJnNwPXImc2lnPTRjWEpJalZSWkhJQldxSGpQZ0RuJTJGMDFvY3pwRFdYaXBtUENVazNaOHZiUSUzRA==" | base64 --decode)
wget -O /tmp/grit_coyo.jsonl $DLINK

python data/visualize_grit.py
```

We recommend using [img2dataset](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset) to download images, as detailed [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zzliang/GRIT#download-image).

## Evaluation

## Training

### Preparing dataset

#### GrIT
After downloading the data from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zzliang/GRIT) using img2dataset, you will obtain some tar files. After decompressing them, you can get the images and corresponding JSON files. Then, modify the file path in [prepare_grit.py](data/prepare_grit.py) and run this file to get the corresponding tsv files. If a tsv file is too large, you can split it into multiple ones yourself.

After processing all the tar files into tsv files, run [generate_config.py](data/generate_config.py) to get a config file, which stores the paths of the tsv files. In [train.sh](train.sh), change the `--laion-data-dir` to the config directory path.

#### Interleaved data
Interleaved image-text data also needs to be processed in this way. To be updated.

#### Text data
To be updated.

### Train script
After preparing the data, run the following command to train the model.
```bash
bash train.sh
```
More training/instruction-tuning tasks will be updated.
